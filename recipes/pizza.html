    <h2>Why I love Making my own Pizza</h2>
    <p>In a world full of culinary shortcuts, there's something truly special about making a pizza from scratch. The smell of the yeasty dough rising, the vibrant red of the tomato sauce simmering on the stove, the glorious melt of cheese bubbling to golden perfection—it's a multi-sensory experience that a frozen box simply can't replicate. Forget complicated ingredients and fussy techniques; this recipe is about embracing the simple joy of creating something delicious with your own hands. </p>
    <p>This isn't just a recipe; it's a foundation. Once you master this simple dough and sauce, you can build your own pizza empire right in your kitchen. Whether you prefer the classic pepperoni, a mountain of fresh vegetables, or something more adventurous like pear and prosciutto, the possibilities are endless. So, grab your apron, roll up your sleeves, and get ready to create the best pizza you've ever had.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast (one packet)</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups warm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can crushed or puréed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for a little heat)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Toppings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese (part-skim or whole milk)</li>
        <li>Optional: Fresh basil leaves, pepperoni, sliced mushrooms, bell peppers, or any of your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel or baking sheet (this helps the pizza slide easily)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Make the Dough</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Activate the yeast: In a large bowl, whisk together the warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, until it becomes foamy. This shows the yeast is active.</li>
        <li>Combine ingredients: Add the olive oil and salt to the yeast mixture. Gradually stir in the flour, about a cup at a time, until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead it for about 5-7 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. If it feels too sticky, add a little more flour, but be careful not to add too much.</li>
        <li>Let it rise: Lightly oil the inside of a clean bowl. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 ½ hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Prepare the Sauce</h4>
    <p>While the dough is rising, you can make the sauce.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté the garlic: In a small saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Simmer the sauce: Pour in the crushed tomatoes. Stir in the dried oregano, red pepper flakes (if using), and a pinch of salt and pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let it cook for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assemble and Bake the Pizza</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven: Place a pizza stone or an inverted baking sheet in the oven and preheat to its highest temperature, typically 500 F (260 C). The hot surface is key to a crispy crust.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough: Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Lightly flour a work surface and your hands. Gently stretch or roll the dough into a 12- to 14-inch circle. Be careful not to tear it.</li>
        <li>Build the pizza: Dust a pizza peel or a large cutting board with cornmeal to prevent sticking. Carefully transfer your dough circle to the peel. Spread an even layer of sauce over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border for the crust. Sprinkle with the shredded mozzarella and any other toppings you're using.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Carefully slide the pizza onto the hot pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Serve: Use the pizza peel or a large spatula to remove the pizza from the oven. Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
