    <h2>How to Make</h2>
    <p>Popovers are a delightful pastry that are surprisingly easy to make. These airy, golden rolls get their name from how they "pop over" the muffin tin as they bake. They're a simple yet impressive treat that requires just a handful of pantry staples: flour, eggs, milk, and a pinch of salt. The magic lies in the high oven temperature and the initial cold batter, which creates a powerful steam that leavens the dough and forms that signature hollow center and crispy shell. </p>
    <p>They can be enjoyed at any time of day, whether you're serving them with butter and jam for a cozy breakfast or alongside a hearty roast for dinner. Their neutral flavor makes them incredibly versatile. You can even experiment with sweet or savory additions like a sprinkle of cinnamon-sugar, some fresh herbs, or a bit of shredded cheese. Popovers are a testament to how the simplest ingredients can create something truly special.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup milk, whole or 2%</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter, plus extra for greasing the pan</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450°F (232°C). Place your popover pan or a 12-cup muffin tin on the middle rack while the oven heats up.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and salt until smooth. A few small lumps are fine. Gradually whisk in the flour until just combined, then stir in the melted butter. Do not overmix the batter. Let the batter rest at room temperature for at least 15-20 minutes, or while the oven finishes preheating.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven. Brush the cups generously with a little extra melted butter.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into each cup, filling them about two-thirds full.</li>
        <li>Immediately return the pan to the preheated oven. Bake at 450°F for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Without opening the oven door, reduce the heat to 350°F (175°C) and continue to bake for another 15-20 minutes, or until the popovers are deep golden brown and firm.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and serve immediately. Popovers deflate as they cool, so they are best enjoyed fresh out of the oven.</li>
    </ol>
